To train the model with the pre-collected data from step 2, simply run the model.py file

# 3 -- Start the program 
To start the main program run the main.py file

# 4 -- Select/Load a Roster
Within the terminal for the main program, you can either enter player names within the program to create a custom roster, or provide a .txt filename for a file that has the desired players listed on seperate lines. (See Provided .txt example files)
